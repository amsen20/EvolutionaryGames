# EvolutionaryGames

This project is the final computational intelligence course project forked from this [link](https://github.com/HosseinZaredar/EvolutionaryGames). <br>
In this project, a neural network is implemented for the agent decision making and an evolutionary (genetic) algorithm is implemented in order to train the neural network in an unsupervised way.
