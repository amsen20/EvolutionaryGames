# EvolutionaryGames

This project is the final computational inteligence course project froked from this [link](https://github.com/HosseinZaredar/EvolutionaryGames).<br>
In this project, a neural network is implemented for the agent decision making and an evolutionary (genetic) algorithm is implemented in order to train neural network in a unsupervied way.
